# Finding the unknown values of standard data sets using Back Propagation Networks
Neural Network is the representation of brain's learning approach. This brain operates as multiprocessor and has excellent interlinked. Neural Network also can be represented as "Parallel distributed processing" planning. It is utilised in the computer applications for solving the complicated problems. There are many benefits from Neural Network such as no requirements for specifying the relevant factors, an unsophisticated model which has many factors for performance, a straightforward model, fault tolerance and an innate synchronous. Perceptron is a very important part of neural networks. It is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers: functions that can decide whether an input (represented by a vector of numbers) belongs to one class or another. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The algorithm allows for learning, in that it processes elements in the training set one at a time.
